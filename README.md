- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Phadoo131
- ðŸ‘€ A newborn dev from the HR field is coming to town.
- Iâ€™m super passionate about Software development, I don't even know how I got to this point.

- Here are the programming languages, frameworks, databases, and other tools I'm familiar with:

* Programming languages: [Python icon] [Go icon] [C# icon] [JavaScript icon] [HTML icon] [CSS icon]
* Frameworks: [Gin icon] [Echo icon] [.NET icon]
* Databases: [PostgreSQL icon] [MySQL icon] [MongoDB icon]
* Others: [Docker icon] [pgAdmin icon] [Google Apps Script icon]

- I'm eager to dig deeper into this field, so feel free to give a suggestion on any parts.
